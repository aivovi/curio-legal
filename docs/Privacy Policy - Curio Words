## 2. What Data We Collect

### 2.1 Data We Do NOT Collect

Curio Words does **not** require you to create an account. We do **not** collect:

- Your name, email address, or phone number
- Passwords or login credentials
- Payment information
- Location data

### 2.2 Data collected automatically

We use **Firebase Analytics** (by Google) to help us understand how the app is used. This runs anonymously and may include:

- App launch and session duration
- Which screens you visit
- Anonymous device identifiers (e.g. device model, OS version)

This data is **aggregated and anonymous** — we cannot identify you personally from it.

### 2.3 Content Delivery (Supabase)

The app downloads word content (vocabulary words and their descriptions) from our backend powered by **Supabase**. This process does **not** transmit or store any personal information — only the word content you see in the app.

## 3. Push Notifications

If you grant permission, we may send you daily word reminders via push notifications. We use **Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)** for this.

- You can withdraw permission at any time in your iPhone's **Settings → Notifications → Curio Words**.
- We do not store your push notification token beyond what is required to deliver notifications on your device.
